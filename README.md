## 🤖 Language Auto-Detection

### How It Works

1. **CSV Analysis**: Reads first 20 rows of your CSV
2. **Pattern Matching**: Checks for:
   - Special characters (ä, ö, ü, ß for German; á, é, í, ñ for Spanish, etc.)
   - Common words (der, die, das for German; the, a, an for English, etc.)
3. **Scoring Algorithm**: Assigns scores to each language
4. **Best Match**: Selects language with highest score
5. **UI Update**: Pre-selects detected language in dropdown

### Supported Languages

| Language | Detection Features |
|----------|-------------------|
| **German (de)** | ä, ö, ü, ß + der, die, das, ist, sind |
| **English (en)** | the, a, an, is, are, was, were |
| **Spanish (es)** | á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ, ¿, ¡ + el, la, es, son |
| **French (fr)** | à, â, ç, é, è, ê, ë + le, la, est, sont |
| **Italian (it)** | à, è, é, ì, ò, ù + il, la, è, sono |

- View all categories with file counts

### Session Statistics

Real-time tracking during Auto-Play:
- Cards reviewed
- Time studying
- Cards per minute

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` | Previous card |
| `→` | Next card |
| `Space` / `Enter` | Reveal translation |
| `P` | Pronounce source word |

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Auto-Detect**: Let the app detect languages first
2. **Use Manual Mapping for Complex CSVs**: If you have custom formats
3. **Enable Auto-Play for Passive Learning**: Great for commutes or workouts
4. **Mark Cards as Learned**: Builds your spaced repetition schedule
5. **Use Study Timers**: Set realistic goals (15-30 min sessions)
6. **Record Sessions**: Review your pronunciation later
7. **Focus Mode for Deep Study**: Eliminate distractions

## 🆘 Support

### Common Issues

**Q: Language auto-detection is wrong**
A: Simply change the dropdown manually. The app will remember your selection and update the label to show "Manually Selected".

**Q: No voices available**
A: Check your browser's text-to-speech settings. Chrome/Edge have the best voice support. Try reloading the page.

**Q: CSV file won't load**
A: Ensure your CSV uses comma, semicolon, pipe, or tab separators. Check for special characters or encoding issues (UTF-8 recommended).

**Q: Progress not saving**
A: Enable cookies and localStorage in your browser. Some incognito/private modes disable storage.

**Q: Recording not working**
A: Grant microphone permissions when prompted. Recording requires HTTPS or localhost in most browsers.

---

### Troubleshooting

#### Language Detection Issues
```javascript
// Check browser console (F12) for detection logs:
// "🔍 Detected languages: { source: 'de', target: 'en' }"
```

#### Voice Issues
```javascript
// Check available voices in console:
window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
```

#### CSV Format Issues
- Verify separator is consistent throughout file
- Check for quotes around text with commas
- Ensure UTF-8 encoding for special characters
- Remove BOM (Byte Order Mark) if present
