📚 NEW FEATURE: Category & Subcategory Management

✓ Add subcategories within categories (e.g., "A1 Vocab")
✓ Assign CSV files to specific categories
✓ Organize multiple vocabulary files
✓ Track which category each file belongs to
✓ Default category for unmapped files

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
┌─ German
│  ├─ A1 Vocabulary
│  ├─ A2 Vocabulary
│  └─ Business Terms
├─ French
│  ├─ Beginner
│  └─ Travel
└─ Default (built-in)
