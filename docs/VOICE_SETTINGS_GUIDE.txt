🎓 LEARNING EFFECTIVENESS:
==================================================

Studies show that CLEAR PRONUNCIATION is more
important than PERFECT ACCENT for language learning.

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Clarity (most important)
2. Consistent speed (0.7-0.9x)
3. Natural pitch (1.0)
4. Accent accuracy (less important)

Even "robotic" voices help if they're CLEAR!

Don't worry too much about perfection - the
important thing is CONSISTENT PRACTICE! 📚
